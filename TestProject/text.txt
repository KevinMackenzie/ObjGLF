This occurs at the beginning of the book, when Campbell is talking to Mengel, one of the guards at the prison in Israel, about how Mengel helped to hang Rudolf Hoess, an official at Auschwitz, before he emigrated.  The leather strap he refers to is the strap that he tied around the feet of Hoess before he hanged him.  I chose this quote because of how the war in so many ways desensitized everyone to death and killing.  This is a common theme throughout the whole story, but this is a different perspective based on a minor character.  This time frame took great men and removed their soul.  It did not seem to matter which side they were fighting on, however there were more on the Allied forces that experienced this;  they both had experienced too much death, disease, famine, and crimes against humanity, that they do not "feel" anymore.  They have been sucked clean of all emotion, and wander the world as if the color was flushed to grays.  Another perspective on this is that the act of strapping the suitcase, like strapping Hoess' ankles, is ending the act of a play, where they are tying up the loose ends to move on, because one cannot continue on their path if their suitcase is open, and also cannot continue living if such a man still lives.
